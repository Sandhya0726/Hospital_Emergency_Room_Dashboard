# Hospital_Emergency_Room_Dashboard
A dashboard to quickly analyse the hospital emergency room.

## Project Overview
This project presents an interactive Hospital Emergency Room (ER) Dashboard designed to monitor patient flow, waiting times, satisfaction levels, and departmental distribution. The dashboard enables hospital administrators and stakeholders to quickly assess ER performance and support data-driven decision-making.

---

## Objectives
- Track total emergency room patient volume
- Monitor average patient waiting time
- Analyze patient satisfaction trends
- Compare admitted vs not admitted patients
- Understand patient distribution by gender and age group
- Identify department-wise patient load
- Enable time-based filtering for monthly and yearly analysis

---

## Key KPIs
- Total Number of Patients
- Average Waiting Time (minutes)
- Average Satisfaction Score
- Admission Status (Admitted vs Not Admitted)

---

## Dashboard Features
- Year and month slicers for dynamic filtering
- KPI summary cards with trend indicators
- Trend analysis using line or area charts
- Comparative analysis using bar charts
- Gender-based patient distribution
- Department-wise patient visit analysis
- Clean and consistent layout with proper spacing and alignment

---

## Dashboard Layout
- Header section containing dashboard title, reporting period, and hospital branding
- Left panel for year and month slicers
